# Titanic-Survival-Prediction

Step-by-Step Approach:

1. Data Preprocessing
Load the Data: Use pandas to read the CSV file.

Handle Missing Values: Check for missing values in critical columns (e.g., Age, Cabin) and decide on a strategy (e.g., fill with mean/median or drop).

Convert Categorical Variables: Use one-hot encoding for categorical features (e.g., Sex, Embarked).

2. Feature Selection
Select Features: Identify relevant features that might influence survival.

3. Model Training
Split the Data: Use train-test split to evaluate model performance.

Choose a Model: Start with a simple model like Logistic Regression.

4. Model Evaluation
Predict and Evaluate: Assess the model's accuracy using metrics like accuracy score and confusion matrix.
